        Businesses require natural-language access to databases without exposing records to large 
        language models, as this compromises data confidentiality and conflicts with governance 
        mandates. This research paper introduces QueryMind, a system that resolves this issue by 
        transforming natural-language enquiries into secure SQL through a schema-aware retrieval-augmented generation pipeline featuring SELECT-only validation. We tested the system on 
        an e-commerce database with five different model configurations. The best setup, llama3.1-8b 
        with mxbai-embed-large, achieved 100% accuracy across all benchmark queries. The entire 
        pipeline averaged 33 seconds per query, with 86% of that time dedicated to LLM generation. 
        The smaller models gave answers faster, in an average of 4 to 7 seconds, but they were only 
        40 to 60 percent accurate. Security tests in five different situations indicated that the system 
        could withstand SQL injection, XSS, and session-hijacking attacks. The performance of local 
        and remote databases was almost the same, with only a 7% difference in total processing 
        times. The results show that bigger LLMs take longer to process, but they make SQL 
        generation more accurate and safer. They also show that a fully local, schema-restricted setup 
        is reliable and keeps data private.
